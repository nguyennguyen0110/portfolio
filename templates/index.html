<h2>Who I am</h2>

<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>
    I'm Nguyen The Anh Nguyen, or Nguyen Nguyen for short. You can also call me Martin. I was born
    in 1987. I'm living in Dong Nai province, Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
    My professional journey began in the printing industry, where I worked as both a graphic designer
    and later a production manager. Over more than a decade, I built expertise in production planning,
    quality control, and collaborating with international partners to implement new technologies. These
    experiences developed my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and leadership abilities.
</p>
<p>
    After being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to pivot toward software development — a
    field that was growing rapidly at the time. I initially taught myself programming, which sparked a
    deep interest in software development. I later formalized my learning through a "Full Stack Java
    Web Developer" course at FPT Academy and a "Data Science" program at Funix. Since then, I have been
    working with Python using Flask and Django to build and deploy backend systems, as well as Java
    with Spring Boot to develop robust backend services.
</p>
<p>
    With hands-on experience in both industrial production and backend development, I bring a unique
    mix of discipline, systems thinking, and technical adaptability.
</p>

<h3>Career direction:</h3>
<p>
    I am currently working full-time in software development, where I continue to strengthen my
    backend skills through real-world projects and ongoing learning.
</p>
<p>
    While my primary focus is on growing as a software engineer, I remain open to new opportunities
    in both software development and production-related roles.
</p>
<p>
    Whether in software or production, I bring discipline, adaptability, and a strong commitment to
    delivering reliable and meaningful results.
</p>
