    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Nguyen The Anh Nguyen, or Nguyen Nguyen for short. You can also call me
        Martin. I was born in 1987. I'm living in Dong Nai province, Vietnam.
    </p>
    <p>
        My professional journey began in the printing industry, where I worked as
        both a graphic designer and later a production manager. Over more than a
        decade, I built expertise in production planning, quality control, and
        collaborating with international partners to implement new technologies.
        These experiences developed my attention to detail, problem-solving skills,
        and leadership abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        After being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to pivot toward
        software development — a field that was growing rapidly at the time. I
        initially taught myself programming, which sparked a deep interest in
        software development. I later formalized my learning through a "Full Stack
        Java Web Developer" course at FPT Academy and a "Data Science" program at
        Funix. Since then, I’ve used Python with Flask to deploy machine
        learning models, and Java with Spring Boot to build robust backend systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        With hands-on experience in both industrial production and backend
        development, I bring a unique mix of discipline, systems thinking, and
        technical agility.
    </p>
    <h3>Career direction:</h3>
    <p>
        I’m currently exploring opportunities in two areas where I can make a strong
        impact: backend development and production (engineering, planning, or
        management).
    </p>
    <p>
        For roles in manufacturing or production, I’m especially drawn to work
        environments that emphasize clear processes, structured workflows, and
        precision — values I deeply admire and strive to align with. To support
        this, I’ve been learning Japanese via Duolingo, inspired by how these
        values are often reflected in Japanese work culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        For software development roles, I’m looking for an environment that values
        collaboration, embraces best practices and clear communication, especially
        where modern tools (like ERP systems or Jira) are in place to support the
        workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether in software or production, I bring discipline, adaptability, and a
        strong drive to contribute meaningfully.
    </p>
